# Pillar

A Flutter monorepo for building scalable applications with clean architecture and modern development practices.

## Overview

Pillar is a collection of Flutter packages organized as a monorepo, designed to provide reusable components, utilities, and architectural patterns for Flutter applications. This project follows clean architecture principles and modern Flutter development best practices.

## Architecture

This monorepo is built using [Melos](https://melos.invertase.dev/) for workspace management and follows the architectural patterns established by projects like [FlutterFire](https://github.com/firebase/flutterfire).

### Key Technologies

- **Flutter & Dart**: Core framework and language
- **GetIt**: Dependency injection
- **Bloc**: State management
- **Freezed**: Immutable data classes and unions
- **Dio & Retrofit**: HTTP client and API integration
- **AutoRoute**: Navigation and routing
- **Firebase**: Backend services integration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (>=3.16.0)
- Dart SDK (>=3.2.0)
- [Melos](https://melos.invertase.dev/) for monorepo management

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pillar.git
cd pillar
```

2. Install Melos globally:
```bash
dart pub global activate melos
```

3. Bootstrap the workspace:
```bash
melos bootstrap
```

## Development
